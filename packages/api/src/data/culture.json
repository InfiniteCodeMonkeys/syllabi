Was Alexander the Great as bad a person as Adolf Hitler? What would Apaches with modern weapons be like? Will our modern civilization ever fall like civilizations from past eras? This isn't academic history (and Carlin isn't a historian) but the podcast's unique blend of high drama, masterful narration and Twilight Zone-style twists has entertained millions of listeners.",

    "description": "\n      <p>Sword and Scale is an internet radio show and website covering the dark underworld of crime and the criminal justice system’s response to it.&nbsp;The first episode launched January 1st, 2014 and feature stories of murder, abduction, rape, and even more bizarre forms of crime.&nbsp;It’s the purest form of&nbsp;true-crime where the raw uncensored audio tells the story.&nbsp;Everything from 911 calls to court testimony, interviews with victims and sometimes with perpetrators give listeners a 360&nbsp;degree look at the seedy underbelly of human nature and so-called civilized society.&nbsp;Told from an everyman's point of view, Sword and Scale goes beyond the news clips and the sensationalist headlines to hold up a mirror to the audience and ask, \"Is it us versus them? Or are we just like 'them' too?\"  Sword and scale proves that the worst monsters are real.</p>\n    ",
