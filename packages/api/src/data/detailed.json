      "description": "<p>In this special podcast episode of The Tony Robbins Podcast, you’ll hear from Tony Robbins, his wife Sage Robbins, and podcast host Mary B., as they discuss the most important tool for creating lasting change: IDENTITY.</p> <p>Have you ever asked yourself, why did I try to make a change but not succeed?  Often, it’s “how” we define ourselves that can lead to either our success or stagnation. </p> <p>As Tony notes, “The most powerful force in the human personality is the need to stay consistent with how we define ourselves.”  In fact, after 45 years of working with people in 195 countries – from the most successful to the most challenged – Tony believes that the single most important element in understanding what drives a person is to understand how they identify themselves.  </p> <p>Identity is simply the culmination of the beliefs that shape how we perceive ourselves. These beliefs control how we think, feel and interact with the world around us.  They also influence what we decide to do (and not do) in our own lives. Therefore, as Sage Robbins explains, what we put after “I am” is something we must always be mindful of. </p> <p>By the end of this conversation, we hope you’ll have the tools and inspiration to update – and upgrade – your own sense of identity.  Maybe it’s time to expand it as you move toward a life of growth.  Or perhaps remove some of those labels that might be limiting you.  </p> <p>Note: In case you’d rather watch the video version of this conversation – which includes behind the scenes footage with Tony, Sage and Mary B – click on the “Expand Your Identity” video that’s on Tony’s YouTube Channel, found at <a href=\"http://youtube.com/TonyRobbinsLive\">youtube.com/TonyRobbinsLive</a>.</p> <p><em>SHOW NOTES</em></p> <p>[00:45]  Introduction by Tony Robbins – <em>The Power of Identity</em></p> <p>[01:25] Definition of Identity</p> <p>[3:32] The downside to identifying oneself</p> <p>[4:04] How attaching the words \"I am\" to something can turn into a belief</p> <p>[6:28] People are not their behaviors</p> <p>[9:23] Identity is the controlling force in life</p> <p>[13:45]  Tony’s goal for this podcast</p> <p>[17:23] Mary B. begins with Tony Robbins trivia: What is Tony's teaching on identity?</p> <p>[18:23] \"The strongest force in the human personality is the need to stay consistent with how we define ourselves.\" – Tony Robbins</p> <p>[19:38] Our behavior is not our entire identity</p> <p>[22:55]  Expanding your identity</p> <p>[25:00] Sage discusses her experience in Dubai </p> <p>[29:09] Sage offers a political identity anecdote </p> <p>[32:41] Questioning our own labels</p> <p>[36:24] Mary discusses the concept of \"chunking\"</p> <p>[38:30] \"Life is an unlearning of who I thought I was.\" - Sage Robbins</p> <p>[44:06] Albert Einstein and widening one's “circle of compassion”</p> <p>[47:23] Who am I?

      "description": "<p>Mindfulness and meditation aren’t just about spirituality or stress relief.</p> <p>In today’s world of constant demands and digital distractions, mindfulness is about making your moments truly matter and living up to your full potential. It’s about your power to put your attention where you want it to be and not on what someone else dangles on a screen in front of you.</p> <p>This is just one reason why Tony Robbins incorporates a gratitude meditation into his daily morning routine to prime his mind every single day.</p> <p>If you’re familiar with any of Tony Robbins peak performance strategies, you know that your ability to maintain a peak state is a key component of living the life you desire. Your state is affected by the way you use your physical body, your ability to direct your mind’s focus, and the language or meaning you give to your experiences.</p> <p>Knowing this, it’s no wonder that we aren’t able to be the best version of ourselves when we are in a stressed state.

      "description": "<p> We’re all here together in this Earth School learning, doing the best we can, making mistakes, picking ourselves back up. The soothing balm that keeps us going is often another’s kindness, caring, connection, and love. Its power is truly transformational.</p> <p>If you think of any great mother, real or archetypal, they have a capacity to love unconditionally – to accept, to allow, to give, to understand, to listen, to nurture. A mother’s love brims with compassion and mercy. Even when their beloved has behavior that may be less desirable, there's still a universal knowingness and a loving essence for the human heart before them.</p> <p>That unconditional aspect of love is what is discussed in this one hour special edition episode. Hear Tony, Sage, and Mary B converse on what it means to sponsor life.</p> <p><em>There's a beauty to life. The mess of it, and the sweetness of it, and the pain of it. And so, it's not to say that there aren’t challenges and that there isn't pain in moments like right now with what's happening on the world stage. But we can contribute to the schism, or we can be a balm. We can be a balm of kindness, and goodness, and look to bring love, light, illumination, presence, connectedness, to be an ear to listen. It's amazing how that can shift another's world. I know what it feels like for me to receive that. I know what it feels like to offer that. And I think that’s a beautiful reality that sometimes in the busyness of life, we can forget how impactful in a moment we can touch another. That we can reach another. That we can move another. That we can remind each other because we're mirroring each other and as we're offering that we're experiencing that. Everything that I'm saying to you in this moment, it's really all selfishly for myself. Life is such a beautiful house of mirrors. We're all reflecting each other.</em></p> <p>- Sage Robbins</p> LISTEN TO THIS PODCAST TO LEARN: <ul> <li>How you can “sponsor” life</li> <li>How to tap into the powerful divine energies that flow through us all</li> <li>What life lessons two new moms have learned already  </li> </ul> <p>SHOW NOTES</p> <p>[2:00] Sage Robbins on “sponsoring life”</p> <p>[7:38] Mary B. & Sage on masculine and feminine energies and archetypes</p> <p>[13:58] On a mother’s unconditional love</p> <p>[14:56] In birth as in death</p> <p>[17:49] The teacher becomes the student</p> <p>[18:11] Tony pops in studio</p> <p>[23:10] Nurturing/Mothering of self</p> <p>[28:45] “You have influence over your children but you don’t have control” - Tony Robbins</p> <p>[31:37] The Serenity Prayer</p> <p>[35:08] Hello, I'm alive!
