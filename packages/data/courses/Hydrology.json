  },
  {
    "name": "Environmental Hydrology",
    "description": "This course examines how hydrology interacts with other physical and biogeochemical processes to shape the natural environment and influence human activities. Students will learn about topics such as water quality, water scarcity, water-related hazards, and water policy and law. They will also study case studies of environmental hydrology problems, such as acid mine drainage, urbanization, drought, and climate change.",
    "prerequisites": ["Hydrologic Modeling"]
  },
  {
    "name": "Independent Research in Hydrology",
    "description": "This course gives students an opportunity to conduct independent research in hydrology under the guidance of a faculty mentor. They will develop research questions, design and execute experiments or simulations, analyze and interpret data, and communicate their findings through oral and written presentations. They will also learn about the ethical and professional aspects of scientific research.",
